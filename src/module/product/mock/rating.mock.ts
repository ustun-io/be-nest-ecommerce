The seller is not allowed to give you the original 80W VOOC charging adapters so that is one drawback - however it isn't the sellers fault. Otherwise, the screen and everything was pristine. There were some scratches on the top of the phone on the metal but my case hides it anyways. There is also something small lodged in one hole of the top speaker grille but it is barely noticeable.",
